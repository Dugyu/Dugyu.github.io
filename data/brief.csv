2,About,About,"Hi, I am Guangyu Du. Welcome to my site. ",About_Cover.jpg,about/,"I am a second-year graduate student at Harvard Graduate School of Design, pursuing my Master in Design Studies Degree concentrated in Technology.  My interest lies in the things that make human human: memories, emotions, relationshipsâ€¦  Trained as an architect,  I am curious about how space can forge lasting emotional connections (intimate relationship).  I believe the answer is in the hybrid of physical and digital world, the immersive and responsive environments, where memories are created during collaborative interactions with augmented physical world and shared explorations in imagined real-time virtual world. I deem myself as a creative coder and digital designer.  I love using algorithms to create beautiful, interactive, real-time spatial and temporal experience. "

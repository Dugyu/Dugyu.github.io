><strong>Harvard Graduate School of Design</strong></a> and joined <a href=""https://senseable.mit.edu"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""
><strong>MIT Senseable City Lab</strong></a> as a Data Visualization Specialist.  Beyond architectural design, I also explore spatial and temporal experience design though computational and interactive media.(<a href=../projects/efface/>Efface</a>, <a href=../projects/loneliness/>Loneliness: A Social Story</a>, <a href='https://youtu.be/qE3yaidoH54'>TA for GSD6338 Intro to Computational Design</a>). My interest lies in the hybrid of the physical and virtual world that helps forge long-lasting social connections. I believe the responsive and immersive environments, part of the emerging technologies, has brought new opportunities for consolidating memories, awakening emotions, and building relationships through collaborative interactions with the augmented physical world and shared explorations in imagined virtual world.

><strong>Tsinghua University, School of Architecture</strong></a>, where I practiced in parametric architectural design.(<a href=../projects/decay/>Evolving Decay</a>, <a href=../projects/cavearch/>CaveArch</a>). In my architectural projects, I intend to give attention to individuals and alleviate the loneliness in contemporary urban conditions using design and computation.  By identifying several urban issues as loneliness inherent in the modern world ( <a href=../projects/obscureloneliness/>Obscure Loneliness</a>), I tried to personate buildings as human beings, understand and develop coherent urban contexts that connect the built environment and our society.","I hope to build a shared mixed reality world that enables individuals to be felt, touched, and connected. I am working on an interface that visualizes emotions, memories, and stories of individuals on this planet. To be continued.","Present,Past,Future",Passion,"<strong>SORROW MAP: An Urban Memory Collector</strong><br>When you feel sad, you probably want someone to resonate with you. The tendency to withdraw and isolate is dangerous. Instead, staying connected and having conversations with others will help you go through the depression. “Sorrow Map” will be a mobile app for collecting stories and memories with location-based data. Users can define their meaningful spaces in a global shared map using names, photos, and music. Stories can be attached to these places only if the user is currently in this location, or he/she has been there before. Different from traditional social networking, “Sorrow Map” requires physical presence before responding to or browsing through others’ stories, encouraging users to get involved in their immediate environment. Through text analyzing, “Sorrow Map” will be responsive to user’s feelings with changes of the elements in the local area, which can also be detected by other users nearby.</n>
<strong>2ND HOME: Space for Relational Connectedness</strong><br>
Whether by choice or circumstances, people who live alone or living with roommates are now more common than the nuclear family and multigenerational family. What will your life be, after work, when others go back home and have dinners with their family? In addition to learning new things, playing with a pet, watching k-drama, and spending time on social media, sharing feelings with others in person is extremely important for mental health. In a world full of commercial spaces designed for families and friends, it's not easy for individuals to start new relationships since the only human interaction is checking out. ""2nd Home"" aims to create a series of home-like spaces that encourage participation in others' life. It restores the lost community in cities. Preparing a healthy and inexpensive dinner together, doing volunteer work, sharing thoughts on current affairs or books, talking about matters in work and life, etc. An izakaya with frequent visitors, not only for eating or drinking but also for helping others with their life. It is possible that ""Sorrow Map"" can be the portal to ""2nd Home"".","sorrowmap-01.jpg,sorrowmap-02.jpg,sorrowmap-03.jpg,sorrowmap-04.jpg,sorrowmap-05.jpg,sorrowmap-06.jpg,sorrowmap-07.jpg,sorrowmap-08.jpg,sorrowmap-09.jpg,2ndhome.jpg",66.65%

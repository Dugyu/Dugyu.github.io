",About_Cover.jpg,about/,"Resume,Resume_GuangyuDu.pdf","I am a second-year graduate student at Harvard Graduate School of Design, pursuing my Master in Design Studies (MDes) Degree concentrated in Technology. Beyond architectural design, I also explore creative coding for spatial and temporal experience though computational and interactive multimedia(<a href=../projects/efface/><strong>Efface</strong></a>, <a href=../projects/loneliness/><strong>Loneliness: A Social Story</strong></a>, <a href=https://youtu.be/qE3yaidoH54><strong>TA for GSD6338 Intro to Computational Design</strong></a>).

I believe the experiences that make humans human, such as consolidating memories, awakening emotions and building relationships… will see new opportunities in the responsive and immersive environments brought by emerging technologies, through collaborative interactions with augmented physical world and shared explorations in imagined virtual world.","I earned my Bachelor of Architecture (B.Arch) in Tsinghua University, the School of Architecture, where I practiced in parametric architectural design(<a href=../projects/decay/><strong>Evolving Decay</strong></a>, <a href=../projects/cavearch/><strong>CaveArch</strong></a>).  I intend to give attention to individuals and alleviate the loneliness in contemporary urban conditions using design and computation.

The tendency to withdraw and isolate is dangerous. Instead, stay connected and talk with others will greatly help you battle depression. “Sorrow Map” will be a mobile app for collecting stories and memories with location-based data.

Different from traditional social networking, “Sorrow Map” requires physical presence before responding to and browsing through others’ stories, encouraging users to get involved in their immediate environment. Through text analyzing, “Sorrow Map” will be responsive to user’s feelings with changes of the local elements, which can also be detected by other users nearby.</n>

",About_Cover.jpg,about/,"Resume,Du_Guangyu_Resume.pdf","My passion is forging long-lasting social connections to alleviate the growing loneliness in the coming decades. Along my diverse and interdisciplinary journey, I am expanding my focus from designing physical spaces to creating digital realms via computational interactive media. I envision a future where AI-driven environments can respond to our memories and emotions, thus helping us build high-quality relationships in the evolving worlds.<br><br> Currently, I work as a Senior Data Engineer at <a href=""https://www.alibabacloud.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><strong>Alibaba Cloud</strong></a>. I was a Data Visualization Specialist at <a href=""https://senseable.mit.edu"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""

I have been exploring the facets of a shared world that make personal stories pronounced in generative design, multi-modal interaction, geospatial experience, and data visualization: <a href=""./static/Du_Guangyu_Project_Catalog.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><strong>Project Catalog</strong></a>.","I earned my Bachelor of Architecture (B.Arch) at <a href=""https://www.arch.tsinghua.edu.cn/column/Home"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><strong>Tsinghua University, School of Architecture</strong></a>, where I practiced in parametric architectural and urban design. In my architectural projects, I intend to give attention to individuals and alleviate the loneliness in contemporary urban conditions using design and computation.  By identifying several urban issues as loneliness inherent in the modern world (<a href=../projects/obscureloneliness/>Obscure Loneliness</a>), I tried to personate buildings as human beings, understand and develop coherent urban contexts that connect the built environment and our society.","I hope to build a shared mixed reality that enables individuals to be felt, touched, and connected. I am working on an interface that visualizes emotions, memories, and stories of individuals on this planet. To be continued.","Present,Past,Future",Passion,"<strong>SORROW MAP: An Urban Memory Collector</strong><br>When you feel sad, you probably want someone to resonate with you. The tendency to withdraw and isolate is dangerous. Instead, staying connected and having conversations with others will help you go through the depression. “Sorrow Map” is a mobile app for collecting stories and memories with location-based data. Users can define their meaningful spaces in a global shared map using names, photos, and music. Stories can be attached to these places only if the user is currently in this location, or he/she has been there before. Different from traditional social networking, “Sorrow Map” requires physical presence before responding to or browsing through others’ stories, encouraging users to get involved in their immediate environment. Through text analyzing, “Sorrow Map” will be responsive to user’s feelings with changes of the elements in the local area, which can also be detected by other users nearby.</n>

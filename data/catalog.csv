One day, Consciousness said “ Let my thought be recorded.” Then the first rudimentary memory fragment fell down, as a tiny feather dropped into the deep. The ripples and wakes generated by the first memory formed the basis of the Swamp, where grew the salt crystals, known as the consolidated new memories.  As the memories crystalized more and more, it became hard for Consciousness to find any of the memory he wanted to recall. He decided to categorize them, using the most frequent memory elements to build the major crystal land structures, which lead to other less important ones, and then the most trivial ones. Since then, memories were separated into pieces scattered all over the land,  a retrieval of an original memory fragment would have to rely on a memory trace, called Engram, which points from the initial element to the second, third, … and final ones. This is the Encoding process.<br>A memory is forgotten not because it disappears in this world, though it somehow decays without the nourish of Salt, but that the memory trace is either broken or being intentionally destroyed, which means that there is no way to find it in the memory land. Without being recalled and reinvigorated, it will fall asleep lonely in the deep, glimmer faint. When a new memory is born in the swamp, it will go through the Consolidation process to form connections with existing memories. Insufficient consolidation time leads to weak engrams, which are vulnerable in the wind and rain of emotions. One day in a fierce emotion rain, consciousness found that he had to erase a series of memories to bring peace back, he used Propanonol (lava particles) to cut the Engram deliberately. Thousands of memories lost their traces forever, that being called, the Slaughter. <br>Born from the resentment of the Slaughter there were Malloc and Memset, who are wishes and desires flying over the memory land. They aspire to fool the Consciousness so as to pass important messages to the Intuition. They and the marginalized memories formed a coalition. Malloc collect the gloomy memories in the deep, while Memset edit and initialize them to become the Dreams. Some Dreams escaped from the census of Consciousness, reached the outsider Intuition, and thus were lucky to go into the re-consolidation process. The newly generated Engram grew larger and larger, at last, they together were a forest above the crystal roots. "

One day, Consciousness said “ Let my thought be recorded.” Then the first rudimentary memory fragment fell down, as a tiny feather dropped into the deep. The ripples and wakes generated by the first memory formed the basis of the Swamp, where grew the salt crystals, known as the consolidated new memories.  As the memories crystalized more and more, it became hard for Consciousness to find any of the memory he wanted to recall. He decided to categorize them, using the most frequent memory elements to build the major crystal land structures, which lead to other less important ones, and then the most trivial ones. Since then, memories were separated into pieces scattered all over the land,  a retrieval of an original memory fragment would have to rely on a memory trace, called Engram, which points from the initial element to the second, third, … and final ones. This is the Encoding process.</n>A memory is forgotten not because it disappears in this world, though it somehow decays without the nourish of Salt, but that the memory trace is either broken or being intentionally destroyed, which means that there is no way to find it in the memory land. Without being recalled and reinvigorated, it will fall asleep lonely in the deep, glimmer faint. When a new memory is born in the swamp, it will go through the Consolidation process to form connections with existing memories. Insufficient consolidation time leads to weak engrams, which are vulnerable in the wind and rain of emotions. One day in a fierce emotion rain, consciousness found that he had to erase a series of memories to bring peace back, he used Propanonol (lava particles) to cut the Engram deliberately. Thousands of memories lost their traces forever, that being called, the Slaughter. </n>Born from the resentment of the Slaughter there were Malloc and Memset, who are wishes and desires flying over the memory land. They aspire to fool the Consciousness so as to pass important messages to the Intuition. They and the marginalized memories formed a coalition. Malloc collect the gloomy memories in the deep, while Memset edit and initialize them to become the Dreams. Some Dreams escaped from the census of Consciousness, reached the outsider Intuition, and thus were lucky to go into the re-consolidation process. The newly generated Engram grew larger and larger, at last, they together were a forest above the crystal roots.",Engram

It’s the discrepancy between the social relationships we want and the ones we have. It is a trait shared among many of us in the modern world, but rarely spoken about. This project focuses on exploring the topic of loneliness as a social story, to raise awareness of this communal phenomenon among people who struggle with it, as well as the rest of the world who may be able to offer helping hands after understanding more about the subject. 
</n>
The website begins with a quote, and then a set of questions that hope to bring the viewers into the context of loneliness, such as “How often do you feel that you have very little in common with the people around you?”. A summary of whether the viewer is likely to be lonely is revealed based on their answers. The result of this questionnaire echos throughout the site. 
</n>
The page goes on and explains the increasing prevalence of loneliness based on international data.
The first visualization depicts the duration of loneliness, giving the impression that there are many people who have been lonely for a long, long time. Supported by the interactive scatter plot, which shows the correlation between loneliness frequency and age, we further emphasize the buildup of loneliness in our life.
</n>
So loneliness increases, and what are the reasons behind? The tree network shows the hierarchy of loneliness factors and their relative influences. 
Then the dot matrix highlights some of these cause-effect relationships,
Including 
age, marital status and negative events as important causation factors,
negative personal and social impacts as adverse consequences. 
</n>
The next section zooms on the country-specific data from the European Social Survey, one of the largest dataset on self-reported loneliness.
The choropleth map allows filtering of different social causes and population groups and displays the percentage of frequently lonely people thereof, with facts and stories as complements. 
</n>
A series of small multiples offers a better comparison of data in each category and in each nation for finding the most prominent factors.  Furthermore, the radar plot explores the odds ratio between these factors and loneliness to quantify each correlation and pick the top three loneliness reasons.
</n>
We now present the three summative categories of influential factors, intimate, relational and collective. We illustrate a series of ways one can help or self help. 
The last line of text is also based on the answers from the questionnaire at the very beginning. For non-lonely viewers, it encourages them to look for ways to help the ones who are struggling, while for lonely viewers, it encourages them to seek help and share their experiences. 
</n>
Although, we live in a lonely world, based on all previous data and visualization, we are not alone.

Even though we have enjoyed much sovereignty in a digital society, the advancement of technology pushes this phenomenon more, leaving one to feel even lonelier—no longer submerged but lost in the sea of connections and urban strangers. </n>
Living in metropolitan cities like Jakarta and Beijing, one would often feel helpless witnessing spatial rights taken away in front of their eyes. In these cities, many public spaces are governed by private institutions that restrict access of the public while the free ones are inadequate, constantly diminished and being replaced. In South Jakarta, Jakartans have nowhere to walk. They have to drive even within a 5-minute walk, as sidewalks are taken by parking lots and commercial sites. In Wudaokou, Beijing, people have no place to sit, as local cafes and bookstores are being replaced by expensive and exclusive restaurants. One’s right to public space is a vital part of creating social infrastructure, which is often overlooked yet has been proven to be crucial in improving civic life (Klinenberg). In cities that are more designed for cars and economic capitals rather than its inhabitants, the resort lies in the connection between existing informal community spaces, such as cafes and art centers, to rebuild the city’s social networks.</n>
While the digital social platforms constantly disconnect people from reality, one cannot deny that everyday apps like Google Maps and Yelp also make life easier. Thus, the progress and turn to the digital world may be geared as a solution to the falling of social infrastructure. The problem with such apps is that they are designed for efficiency rather than quality, rendering information without hierarchy and resulting in a virtual world where there is no need or desire to maintain physical social infrastructure. How can digital social platforms be used to connect people to rebuild social infrastructure and the city? </n>
Our goal is to study how media can enhance solidarity by creating effective networks in reality. We created a website called JOURNEY that enables people to express their opinions on urban environments and find places to meet other people with similar motivations. Our project was inspired by bottom-up urban movements, such as LA Urban Rangers and Death Café. The former develops guided tours to spark creative explorations of everyday habitat while the latter hosts small events in local cafes around the world to discuss death and live a better life. We also look into AR game Ingress for location-based social platforms. </n>
In this project, we are specifically analyzing two areas in metropolises: South Jakarta and Wudaokou. Both areas are highly packed commercial districts where spatial rights are always contested. We started to look at a few informal cafes in our neighborhoods that have a broader community network.  In Wudaokou: Bridge, students’ favorite study room; Lush, the home for foreign students and teachers; Me After You, where you can find Korean translation; Mann, the hub for Beijing drifters; and local Ingress ENL.  Jakarta: Cyclo Coffee & Apparel, a cycling community; Ruang Seduh, where coffee ad independent film enthusiasts gather; Suwe Ora Jamu, a traditional medical drink and art center; and Kopi Manyar, a place for coffee, architecture and design. We are speculating that our implementations would help rebuild the social and physical infrastructure of these two areas, which would be developed and implemented in other areas and cities in the future.</n>
Journey is a key and portal to the real world, through which people can have access to neighbourhoods’ cafes and join their community. Unlike other apps like Yelp and Google Maps, Journey will filter cafes that have a broader community network (such as: art, film, cycling, students, etc.) than just a commercial component. Thus, the app becomes a tool of social empowerment, connecting people with actual places and communities that they usually do not have access to—a casual way to interact.</n>
Journey is designed into two parts, Tour and Meet. The Tour deals with the image of a city, it will create a spectacle that attracts people to the issue. Once a month, each cafe would hold a tour where the community would walk the street, wearing a distinctive attire associated with Journey, and use the app to take pictures and report sidewalk conditions to fix the street. Thus, the app not only connects people to the events happening in an interior environment, but also events that are happening in an open space, e.g. a small park, the streets. It becomes a social empowerment tool for sidewalk reclamation, which also has the potential of connecting the different communities. The Meet aspect will provide individuals and communities with a way to contribute and improve our city. Local cafes are the “stations/stops” to host events and “museums/libraries” to store local knowledge and distribute copies of published media(guide/map/poster/flyer).  Both individuals and small business can benefit from being exposed to this network.</n>
For implementation, Journey has the following main features: Map, attached to geolocations, in local view which renders immersive local environments for exploring, and a global view rendering all stops in the area for searching; Calendar which shows when there will be tours and meets; Journal, an archive of past events and a track of current events, with posters, images, comments, collective production included; Report, a portal to submit daily urban environment related comments and proposals in the form of images, drawings and texts. Note, these media will be attached to specific geolocations. Vibes: where users can reach out to each other; and Profile, where users can highlight their interests and contributions on the reports on the city.</n>
After real implementation, we received useful feedbacks from local students at Cambridge and Beijing. For further exploration, it would be useful to add a search function and implement different languages that could improve the discoverability feature of the media. Another improvement could be geared towards the creation a local community of reviewers that could manage the social network from being commercialized. This project is a starting point on the use of social media and technology development to improve our urban metropolitan cities: how can a social media become an empowerment tool for findability and discoverability of social networks that will turn urban strangers into urban families.",

The motivation behind is about creating an instinctual experience that demands the minimum input, responds to our ‘stillness’ and ‘idleness’, and makes us feel our ‘existence’.  This subtle interaction (or even not an explicit interaction  at  all,  but  the  feeling  that  the  system  are  in  sync  with  us)  is extremely useful when people are in a depressed mood, feeling lack of energy to do anything more than just moving their eyes.  Quite often they will be trapped in a hopeless cycle:  the lower their mood is, the more aversion they are to activities, the less possible that they will recover from depression. By experiencing  Efface  effortlessly,  users  are  expect  to  feel  their  own influence on the virtual landscape and others’ presence in this shared world, acquiring empowerment, connectivity and satisfaction.","The system has two tasks: First, to navigate a virtual landscape smoothly and freely using only gaze and head pose.  Second, the landscape gives visual response to user’s focus through its color and form changes. <br><br>
<strong>Gaze</strong><br>By looking at different parts of the landscape or sky, the user can dive exactly towards what he or she is focusing at. By looking at the targets (white particles) in the landscape, users can have drifting/orbiting experience towards/around the targets. Head Pose: Leaning or moving head out of the relaxed area will move camera accordingly, in forward/ backward / left / right / up / down directions. <br><br>
<strong>Terrain Color</strong><br>Users will leave patterns on the land they are passing through according to their gaze moving speed.  Stillness creates constant-size circle, whereas rapid movements result in smaller yet more varied shapes. The color change of the terrain will then cause terrain's vibrations (vertices moving vertically). <br><br>
<strong>Glow of Targets</strong><br>On receiving user's focus, those targets (`neurons', the static large white particles) will have a larger range of glow, which in turn attracts the user more.  <br><br>
<strong>Density of Triangle Fragments</strong><br>Triangle fragments gradually appears and disappears, falling down from the sky to the swamp, representing the formation, consolidation, re-consolidation and effacement of our memories (just my fun interpretation). The interaction is, the more user looks at a target (a neuron that controls the flow of memory fragments), the denser of triangle fragments in the branches controlled by that target. Meanwhile, other branches will become thinner, representing memories being forgotten.","Efface is an interactive virtual landscape in Unity that can be navigated through gaze and head pose using Tobii Eye Tracking SDK. The system detects user's gaze point on screen for ray-tracing the actual hitpoint being looked at in the landscape, which then drives the camera rotation. It also picks user's head position change for camera translation and uses focused target for orbiting and drifting. Some visual feedback includes: redistribution of triangle meshes and target glowing according to focus, landscape color change according to user's gaze movement changing rate.

In the beginning, Consciousness is only complete darkness, with faint sounds at a distance. One day, Consciousness said “ Let my thought be recorded.” Then the first rudimentary memory fragment fell down, as a tiny feather dropped into the deep. The ripples and wakes generated by the first memory formed the basis of the Swamp, where grew the salt crystals, known as the consolidated new memories.  As the memories crystalized more and more, it became hard for Consciousness to find any of the memory he wanted to recall. He decided to categorize them, using the most frequent memory elements to build the major crystal land structures, which lead to other less important ones, and then the most trivial ones. Since then, memories were separated into pieces scattered all over the land,  a retrieval of an original memory fragment would have to rely on a memory trace, called Engram, which points from the initial element to the second, third, … and final ones. This is the Encoding process.</n>
<strong>The Slaughter</strong><br>
A memory is forgotten not because it disappears in this world, though it somehow decays without the nourish of Salt, but that the memory trace is either broken or being intentionally destroyed, which means that there is no way to find it in the memory land. Without being recalled and reinvigorated, it will fall asleep lonely in the deep, glimmer faint. When a new memory is born in the swamp, it will go through the Consolidation process to form connections with existing memories. Insufficient consolidation time leads to weak engrams, which are vulnerable in the wind and rain of emotions. One day in a fierce emotion rain, consciousness found that he had to erase a series of memories to bring peace back, he used Propanonol (lava particles) to cut the Engram deliberately. Thousands of memories lost their traces forever, that being called, the Slaughter. </n>
<strong>The Rebellion</strong><br>
Born from the resentment of the Slaughter there were Malloc and Memset, who are wishes and desires flying over the memory land. They aspire to fool the Consciousness so as to pass important messages to the Intuition. They and the marginalized memories formed a coalition. Malloc collect the gloomy memories in the deep, while Memset edit and initialize them to become the Dreams. Some Dreams escaped from the census of Consciousness, reached the outsider Intuition, and thus were lucky to go into the re-consolidation process. The newly generated Engram grew larger and larger, at last, they together were a forest above the crystal roots.",Dugyu/Engram,NA

We hope to use this project as an opportunity to explore the multitude of the subject through referencing and comparing existing quantitative and qualitative research data. Goal: To raise awareness about the new global problem loneliness through exploring and systematizing it in modern day context, especially in relation to societal setting and affective manifestation. 
","We hope to raise awareness about the new global problem loneliness through our storytelling and data visualizations. Firstly, we would like to show the widespread loneliness across the world, and how it has increased since the past years (We are lonelier than before).  We will also present key facts about loneliness regarding population characteristics and different regions. Secondly, we want to explore what are the reasons behind the loneliness in modern societies. We know that it’s hard to weigh an emotion, especially when it does not have antonyms. So we choose to show the multitude of related factors and how they manifested in different countries. Thirdly, by comparing the lifestyles of those who report loneliness and ordinary people, we try to give some recommendations for alleviating loneliness.

The website begins with a quote, and then a set of questions that hope to bring the viewers into the context of loneliness, such as “How often do you feel that you have very little in common with the people around you?”. A summary of whether the viewer is likely to be lonely is revealed based on their answers. The result of this questionnaire echos throughout the site.

The first visualization depicts the duration of loneliness, giving the impression that there are many people who have been lonely for a long, long time. Supported by the interactive scatter plot, which shows the correlation between loneliness frequency and age, we further emphasize the buildup of loneliness in our life.

So loneliness increases, and what are the reasons behind? The tree network shows the hierarchy of loneliness factors and their relative influences. 
Then the dot matrix highlights some of these cause-effect relationships, including age, marital status and negative events as important causation factors, negative personal and social impacts as adverse consequences. 
</n>
The next section zooms on the country-specific data from the European Social Survey, one of the largest dataset on self-reported loneliness. The choropleth map allows filtering of different social causes and population groups and displays the percentage of frequently lonely people thereof, with facts and stories as complements. A series of small multiples offers a better comparison of data in each category and in each nation for finding the most prominent factors.  Furthermore, the radar plot explores the odds ratio between these factors and loneliness to quantify each correlation and pick the top three loneliness reasons.

We now present the three summative categories of influential factors, intimate, relational and collective. We illustrate a series of ways one can help or self help.  The last line of text is also based on the answers from the questionnaire at the very beginning. For non-lonely viewers, it encourages them to look for ways to help the ones who are struggling, while for lonely viewers, it encourages them to seek help and share their experiences.

If any city can buck the bloated, wasteful, and cynical public image of the Olympics in recent years, it’s probably Tokyo. This time, rather than building entirely new venues, the organizing committee plan to use as many existing competition venues as possible. They will retrofit existing structures throughout the city, including three major venues originally built for the 1964 Summer Games. The Tokyo National Stadium, where the Opening and Closing Ceremonies and the Athletics competitions will be staged, will be completely revamped and replaced by this new Olympic park. By interpreting architecture as natural chaotic systems, the design aims to capture the intuitive, situational, and paradoxical character in Japanese culture, the evanescence and insubstantiality of things, and the transitory nature of the floating world. The atmosphere in the proposed Olympic Park is relaxing with water and vegetation. Venues, tracks, shelters and pedestrian routes are brought together in a continuous, unpredictable and non-linear form, creating the adventure-like visiting experience for both athletes and the public.","The 2020 Tokyo Olympic Park is situated near the Meiji Jingu Gaien, surrounded by national gardens, stadiums and cemetery. In the proximity of Akasaka Imperial Gardens, its post development is subject to many restrictions. With minimum architecture in the future, the park serves as an oasis connecting surrounding outdoor resources. To capture the sensitive characteristics in Japanese culture and make the Olympic Park a dynamic system, vector field and particle movements are chosen to present the correlations within different sports programs as continuously changing swirls.  Variations of orientation charges will result in attractive and repulsive forces. Eighteen eddies were put into the original vector field, where the orientation adjustment is set to be 0.25 * pi. The orientation adjustment caused by eddies damps from the center of effective range to its boundary. Eddies then imparts rejection-attraction forces to the flowing particles nearby, speeding up or down their movements. Venues are mainly designated for indoor sports, as well as the outdoor sports that have strict requirements on tracks. The trajectory of particles is transforming into structure skeletons, with tension membrane being the outer skins.","By viewing architecture as life, it is clear that days are numbered. Decadency comes soon after the day it was built, especially for such sports infrastructure that are built mainly for the two-week games. What we should do is not leaving it isolated, but consider it being a continuously evolving process. 2020: During Tokyo Olympics, temporary stands are merged with the landscape, providing sufficient seats and shelters for the audience. Reusable light steel and removable fabrics are used as the skeleton and skin of the stadiums. 2025: After the Olympics, the stadiums will be transformed into Tokyo Disney Universe, a theme park that aims to help cover expenditures of Tokyo Olympics and attract people to the place after the games. 2035: In the near future, new cultural facilities and trees will gradually replace previous structures as the Olympics’ after effect has gradually faded, while the landscape is maintained in case of future events. The park will then become a forest with bio-diversity and various urban activities. After the Olympics, the park is transformed into an ever-changing, multi-functional urban forest, with thousands of trees grown to provide urban life that embraces nature.

Sediment laboratory was a clear span space used by the Department of Civil Engineering. Although it is located in the center of the campus, students outside the Department of civil engineering are unconscious about its existence, not to mention what is happening inside, even if they pass by every day. The indifference to the immediate environment should be attributed to the highly specialized and complexed society: The division of labor circumscribed people in specific tasks and roles, making social connections superficial and shallow. E-Services enable individuals to live a comfortable life by themselves. The grand scale of urban spaces and complexed needs lead to the gigantic building, whose façade can no longer reveal what happens inside, transforming the city from a summation of certainties into an accumulation of mysteries. In laboratory renovation, we aim to transform the isolated specialized space into a new center for student activities while still keeping the enchantment of the clear span space. A bicycle bridge will wind itself over the laboratory, a new transparent façade will displace the concrete structure, and a both invite visitors to walk in and explore the versatile components inside.

<strong>Surviving Emptiness</strong><br>
On March 2011, a massive earthquake sent a 120-foot-high tsunami smashing into the coast of north-east Japan. More than 18,500 people had been crushed, burned to death or drowned. It was Japan’s greatest single loss of life since the atomic bombing of Nagasaki. It set off a national crisis and left prolonged unbearable influence on those who lived through the epic tragedy. Even for Japan, a nation that is always prepared for sudden disasters, the inherent precariousness of modern cities is inevitable, regardless of technological progress, or deep down, the completeness of a modern city and its resistibility is inversely related. The artificial environment is fragile than the natural environment. Thus it was preordained that destruction will manifest itself one day in some forms. How a nation faces a catastrophe and finds consolation in ruins, as well as how an individual assuages the emptiness after the loss and starts to rebuild memory again, will be closely related with the way we construct and contextualize our cities. In this design, I want to question the legitimacy of architecture to be tangible, unbreakable and carefully-designed by pointing out the efficacy of improvised virtual architecture as a ritual for memory.

<strong>Alleviating Rejection</strong><br>
For decades the simple act of walking was overlooked by city planners but, no matter how you choose to get around your city, the chances are that you are a pedestrian at some point during the day. Cities were made for walking, but cars have taken over. As a result, urban spaces are often designed for vehicles, making pedestrians helpless. Poorly designed sidewalks, unwelcome frontage, and fragmented public spaces all add to the depression of walkers. Recently, walkability Index of a city has raised attention worldwide because it has a huge impact on social life, health, economic and environmental sustainability. This design thesis project aims to study and categorize the related concepts of walkability, set up guidelines for future urban design. The aspects involved are based on the literature review of Ann Forsyth (2015). Nine themes are further developed into a hierarchy framework demonstrating safety, systematisms, and diversity. As part of the Urban Design Guideline research group project, this thesis mainly focuses on design guidelines for the campus of THU, where the central conflict is between bike riders and walkers, as the vast area of the university does not encourage walking. In addition to student walkers, university visitors are facing a more awkward condition, since most open spaces are not inviting the public to stay.

<strong>Breaching Norms</strong><br>
Hufangqiao is an area located to the southwest of Beijing’s historic city wall, part of the Dashilar Sub-district. Despite being the former entertainment and commercial center of Beijing, Dashilar serves as an outsider of the central city throughout the history, either regarding the location or its residents, who were mainly the lower class. In modern times, this area is getting sordid; even business has been on the decline. The contributing factor is 1976 Tangshan Earthquake which resulted in shelters added to the courtyards. The late 90’s rising population and high demand for low rent housing made these temporary structures became permanent. In last decade, the curiosity towards Hutong community culture made Dashilar a tourist attraction. However, the local residents do not benefit much from this trend; instead, due to the preservation code in this historical area, they have to endure the lack of facilities, space, privacy, and dignity. This area faces similar struggles in all historical regions in the world, high population density, inadequate public services, degradation of the public scene, and a lack of local business trade. The inherent contradiction lies between the individual and collective memory, with the latter being inevitably more focused. However, this design gives special importance to the wish of local residents, by reexamining and being prudent of our nostalgia towards historical buildings.",NA,NA

10,LePetitPrince,Le Petit Prince,Unexpected Shadows,2018,Fall,Shiyi Peng,Panagiotis Michalatos,Computataional,Rhinocereos,"Grasshopper,C#",NA,This project focuses on generating shadows of arbitrary forms through ray-tracing. The goal is to cast unexpected shadows of the rose and the little prince from a small stone on the planet.,"Shadow calculation starts from shadow boundary curves and a matrix of points. For each point in the matrix, construct a ray from each of the two point lights, test if the projected points are within the boundaries of target shadows, if both of the two shadow boundaries contain the point, then this point is kept, otherwise removed. In the end, place small mesh cubes at each of the remaining points, merge all cubes to produce a single mesh.","The audience will see the red and emerald shadows of the rose and the little prince, but wondering where are the original objects.

We created a website called JOURNEY that enables people to express their opinions on urban environments and find places to meet other people with similar motivations.  Our project was inspired by bottom-up urban movements, such as LA Urban Rangers and Death Café: the former develops guided tours to spark creative explorations of everyday habitat; the latter hosts small events in local cafes around the world to discuss death and live a better life. We also look into AR game Ingress for location-based social platforms.","In this project, we are specifically analyzing two areas in metropolises: South Jakarta and Wudaokou. Both areas are highly packed commercial districts where spatial rights are always contested. We started to look at a few informal cafes in our neighborhoods that have a broader community network. In Wudaokou: Bridge, students’ favorite study room; Lush, the home for foreign students and teachers; Me After You, where you can find Korean translation; Mann, the hub for Beijing drifters; and local Ingress ENL.  Jakarta: Cyclo Coffee & Apparel, a cycling community; Ruang Seduh, where coffee ad independent film enthusiasts gather; Suwe Ora Jamu, a traditional medical drink and art center; and Kopi Manyar, a place for coffee, architecture and design. We developed a web app using python, Flask, JavaScript and Google Map’s API, offers the audience opportunities to mark important places, such as these cafes, and leave geo-location based comments. ","Journey is a key and portal to the real world, through which people can have access to neighborhoods’ cafes and join their community. Unlike other apps like Yelp and Google Maps, Journey will filter cafes that have a broader community network (such as: art, film, cycling, students, etc.) than just a commercial component. Thus, the app becomes a tool of social empowerment, connecting people with actual places and communities that they usually do not have access to—a casual way to interact. Journey is designed into two parts, Tour and Meet. The Tour deals with the image of a city, it will create a spectacle that attracts people to the issue. Once a month, each cafe would hold a tour where the community would walk the street, wearing a distinctive attire associated with Journey, and use the app to take pictures and report sidewalk conditions to fix the street. Thus, the app not only connects people to the events happening in an interior environment, but also events that are happening in an open space, e.g. a small park, the streets. It becomes a social empowerment tool for sidewalk reclamation, which also has the potential of connecting the different communities. The Meet aspect will provide individuals and communities with a way to contribute and improve our city. Local cafes are the “stations/stops” to host events and “museums/libraries” to store local knowledge and distribute copies of published media(guide/map/poster/flyer).  Both individuals and small business can benefit from being exposed to this network.",,Find and Discover Spaces of Solidarity,Journey_Cover.jpg,56.25%,Journey_Short.mp4,"Journey_Cover.jpg,Journey_Draft01.jpg,Journey_Draft02.jpg,Journey_Draft03.jpg,Journey_Draft04.jpg,Journey_Draft05.jpg,Journey_Draft06.jpg,Journey_Draft07.jpg,Journey_Draft08.jpg,Journey_Draft09.jpg,Journey_Draft10.jpg,Journey_Draft11.jpg",Dw8Iikb0nsE,Youtube,,NA,Dugyu/journey,"Demo,http://journey.dugyu.com</n>Course,http://spacesofsolidarity.org/research/"

The challenge is, we didn’t have previous experience with ARCore, and we ran into problems setting up cloud anchors.

The video projection on architectural facade assigns new meaning to the specific site, in this case, questions about the relationship between individuals and institutions. Gund Hall is a typical building within an academic institution. Design students, faculty and visiting scholars are all granted social roles from this massive architectural machine. Yet, the commonalities brought by this institution may also cast shadows on the diversified voices of the multitude.","The projected video is composed of a still image (the eye) and a video footage (the hand). The appearance of the eye image on the building facade is first tested with a mini-projector before final composition. To merge the two elements seamlessly, the hand was behind a black curtain when being shot. ","A hand going out of the wall of an institution could be understood as struggling but also sensing.  Institutions make us feel secure as it is our affiliation, our primary definition and dependence in this society.  Yet we also have the deepest fear that it may trap us, shape us, or assimilate us. Even we are part of an institution, we always have an inherent desire to get rid of it. Meanwhile, the hand going out  of an eye could be a metaphor of our senses toward this world: how we see this world for the first time, how we touch the air, the hard and soft surfaces surround us.  Have we changed since we entered this society, started working in these institutions?  Could we maintain our curiosity and sensitivity from the first born?

Through comic style media masks/glasses, we want to address that technology has already become a part of our image and an extension of our body. We hide our emotions and feelings behind mobile devices and ubiquitous sapphire screens thereof, let digital technology creates and shapes our social image.","In the beginning, we prototyped the mask using cardboard taken directly from a package box. We cut two holes for eyes but in different shapes, a circle and a square to exaggerate the comic style. For better wearable experience, we also tested Google cardboard VR headset, but find it lost the simplistic yet dramatic nature.  In the end we combined the two prototypes, use Google cardboard as the wearable base and package box as the comic frontage. We also refined the shape of the holes, making them perfect geometric shapes with clear boundaries.  ","When you look at my eye, you are not looking at my physical eye, instead, what you see is actually a virtual eye on a cell phone.  This changes how we look at other people and how we are being looked at. By enlarging just one eye through a cell phone, we want to make a metaphor of objectification brought by everyday technology. A delay between two eyes blinking is visible through the delay of the camera signal.  Media Masks is made of cheap cardboard with only cell phones, which is in accordance with the theme of objectification through everyday objects.",,"We hide our emotions and feelings behind mobile devices and ubiquitous sapphire screens thereof, let digital technology creates and shapes our social image.

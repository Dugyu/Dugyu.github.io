2,Efface,Efface,Gaze Interactive Generative Virtual Landscape ,2019,Spring,Individual,Panagiotis Michalatos,"Mixed Reality Experience, Computational, Interactive","Unity, C#",Eye-Tracking,NA,"This project aims for a shared virtual landscape created simply by human existence. The motivation behind is about creating an instinctual experience that demands the minimum input, responds to our ‘stillness’ and ‘idleness’, and makes us feel our ‘existence’.  This subtle interaction (or even not an explicit interaction  at  all,  but  the  feeling  that  the  system  are  in  sync  with  us)  is extremely useful when people are in a depressed mood, feeling lack of energy to do anything more than just moving their eyes.  Quite often they will be trapped in a hopeless cycle:  the lower their mood is, the more aversion they are to activities, the less possible that they will recover from depression. By experiencing  Efface  effortlessly,  users  are  expect  to  feel  their  own influence on the virtual landscape and others’ presence in this shared world, acquiring empowerment, connectivity and satisfaction.","The system has two tasks: First, to navigate a virtual landscape smoothly and freely using only gaze and head pose.  Second, the landscape gives visual response to user’s focus through its color and form changes. Gaze: By looking at different parts of the landscape or sky, the user can dive exactly towards what he or she is focusing at. By looking at the targets (white particles) in the landscape, users can have drifting/orbiting experience towards/around the targets. Head Pose: Leaning or moving head out of the relaxed area will move camera accordingly, in forward/ backward / left / right / up / down directions. Terrain Color: Users will leave patterns on the land they are passing through according to their gaze moving speed.  Stillness creates constant-size circle, whereas rapid movements result in smaller yet more varied shapes. The color change of the terrain will then cause terrain's vibrations (vertices moving vertically). Glow of Targets: On receiving user's focus, those targets (`neurons', the static large white particles) will have a larger range of glow, which in turn attracts the user more.  Density of Triangle Fragments: Triangle fragments gradually appears and disappears, falling down from the sky to the swamp, representing the formation, consolidation, re-consolidation and effacement of our memories (just my fun interpretation). The interaction is, the more user looks at a target (a neuron that controls the flow of memory fragments), the denser of triangle fragments in the branches controlled by that target. Meanwhile, other branches will become thinner, representing memories being forgotten.","Efface is an interactive virtual landscape in Unity that can be navigated through gaze and head pose using Tobii Eye Tracking SDK. The system detects user's gaze point on screen for ray-tracing the actual hitpoint being looked at in the landscape, which then drives the camera rotation. It also picks user's head position change for camera translation and uses focused target for orbiting and drifting. Some visual feedback includes: redistribution of triangle meshes and target glowing according to focus, landscape color change according to user's gaze movement changing rate.

One day, Consciousness said “ Let my thought be recorded.” Then the first rudimentary memory fragment fell down, as a tiny feather dropped into the deep. The ripples and wakes generated by the first memory formed the basis of the Swamp, where grew the salt crystals, known as the consolidated new memories.  As the memories crystalized more and more, it became hard for Consciousness to find any of the memory he wanted to recall. He decided to categorize them, using the most frequent memory elements to build the major crystal land structures, which lead to other less important ones, and then the most trivial ones. Since then, memories were separated into pieces scattered all over the land,  a retrieval of an original memory fragment would have to rely on a memory trace, called Engram, which points from the initial element to the second, third, … and final ones. This is the Encoding process.</n>A memory is forgotten not because it disappears in this world, though it somehow decays without the nourish of Salt, but that the memory trace is either broken or being intentionally destroyed, which means that there is no way to find it in the memory land. Without being recalled and reinvigorated, it will fall asleep lonely in the deep, glimmer faint. When a new memory is born in the swamp, it will go through the Consolidation process to form connections with existing memories. Insufficient consolidation time leads to weak engrams, which are vulnerable in the wind and rain of emotions. One day in a fierce emotion rain, consciousness found that he had to erase a series of memories to bring peace back, he used Propanonol (lava particles) to cut the Engram deliberately. Thousands of memories lost their traces forever, that being called, the Slaughter. </n>Born from the resentment of the Slaughter there were Malloc and Memset, who are wishes and desires flying over the memory land. They aspire to fool the Consciousness so as to pass important messages to the Intuition. They and the marginalized memories formed a coalition. Malloc collect the gloomy memories in the deep, while Memset edit and initialize them to become the Dreams. Some Dreams escaped from the census of Consciousness, reached the outsider Intuition, and thus were lucky to go into the re-consolidation process. The newly generated Engram grew larger and larger, at last, they together were a forest above the crystal roots.",Dugyu/Engram,NA

Goal: To raise awareness about the new global problem loneliness through exploring and systematizing it in modern day context, especially in relation to societal setting and affective manifestation. 
","We hope to raise awareness about the new global problem loneliness through our storytelling and data visualizations. Firstly, we would like to show the widespread loneliness across the world, and how it has increased since the past years (We are lonelier than before).  We will also present key facts about loneliness regarding population characteristics and different regions. Secondly, we want to explore what are the reasons behind the loneliness in modern societies. We know that it’s hard to weigh an emotion, especially when it does not have antonyms. So we choose to show the multitude of related factors and how they manifested in different countries. Thirdly, by comparing the lifestyles of those who report loneliness and ordinary people, we try to give some recommendations for alleviating loneliness.

The website begins with a quote, and then a set of questions that hope to bring the viewers into the context of loneliness, such as “How often do you feel that you have very little in common with the people around you?”. A summary of whether the viewer is likely to be lonely is revealed based on their answers. The result of this questionnaire echos throughout the site.

The page goes on and explains the increasing prevalence of loneliness based on international data.
The first visualization depicts the duration of loneliness, giving the impression that there are many people who have been lonely for a long, long time. Supported by the interactive scatter plot, which shows the correlation between loneliness frequency and age, we further emphasize the buildup of loneliness in our life.
</n>
So loneliness increases, and what are the reasons behind? The tree network shows the hierarchy of loneliness factors and their relative influences. 
Then the dot matrix highlights some of these cause-effect relationships,
Including 
age, marital status and negative events as important causation factors,
negative personal and social impacts as adverse consequences. 
</n>
The next section zooms on the country-specific data from the European Social Survey, one of the largest dataset on self-reported loneliness.
The choropleth map allows filtering of different social causes and population groups and displays the percentage of frequently lonely people thereof, with facts and stories as complements.

A series of small multiples offers a better comparison of data in each category and in each nation for finding the most prominent factors.  Furthermore, the radar plot explores the odds ratio between these factors and loneliness to quantify each correlation and pick the top three loneliness reasons.
</n>
We now present the three summative categories of influential factors, intimate, relational and collective. We illustrate a series of ways one can help or self help. 
The last line of text is also based on the answers from the questionnaire at the very beginning. For non-lonely viewers, it encourages them to look for ways to help the ones who are struggling, while for lonely viewers, it encourages them to seek help and share their experiences.

Even though we have enjoyed much sovereignty in a digital society, the advancement of technology pushes this phenomenon more, leaving one to feel even lonelier—no longer submerged but lost in the sea of connections and urban strangers. </n>
Living in metropolitan cities like Jakarta and Beijing, one would often feel helpless witnessing spatial rights taken away in front of their eyes. In these cities, many public spaces are governed by private institutions that restrict access of the public while the free ones are inadequate, constantly diminished and being replaced. In South Jakarta, Jakartans have nowhere to walk. They have to drive even within a 5-minute walk, as sidewalks are taken by parking lots and commercial sites. In Wudaokou, Beijing, people have no place to sit, as local cafes and bookstores are being replaced by expensive and exclusive restaurants. One’s right to public space is a vital part of creating social infrastructure, which is often overlooked yet has been proven to be crucial in improving civic life (Klinenberg). In cities that are more designed for cars and economic capitals rather than its inhabitants, the resort lies in the connection between existing informal community spaces, such as cafes and art centers, to rebuild the city’s social networks.</n>
While the digital social platforms constantly disconnect people from reality, one cannot deny that everyday apps like Google Maps and Yelp also make life easier. Thus, the progress and turn to the digital world may be geared as a solution to the falling of social infrastructure. The problem with such apps is that they are designed for efficiency rather than quality, rendering information without hierarchy and resulting in a virtual world where there is no need or desire to maintain physical social infrastructure. How can digital social platforms be used to connect people to rebuild social infrastructure and the city? </n>

For implementation, Journey has the following main features: Map, attached to geolocations, in local view which renders immersive local environments for exploring, and a global view rendering all stops in the area for searching; Calendar which shows when there will be tours and meets; Journal, an archive of past events and a track of current events, with posters, images, comments, collective production included; Report, a portal to submit daily urban environment related comments and proposals in the form of images, drawings and texts. Note, these media will be attached to specific geolocations. Vibes: where users can reach out to each other; and Profile, where users can highlight their interests and contributions on the reports on the city.</n>
After real implementation, we received useful feedbacks from local students at Cambridge and Beijing. For further exploration, it would be useful to add a search function and implement different languages that could improve the discoverability feature of the media. Another improvement could be geared towards the creation a local community of reviewers that could manage the social network from being commercialized.

7,Decay,Evolving Decay,Dynamic Olympic Park Design,2017,Spring,Jiayi Wang,Weiguo Xu,"Architectural, Computational",Rhinocereos,"Grasshopper, Python",NA,"In Japan, the notion of impermanence is about change and renewal, demolition and rebuilding.  If any city can buck the bloated, wasteful, and cynical public image of the Olympics in recent years, it’s probably Tokyo. This time, rather than building entirely new venues, the organizing committee plan to use as many existing competition venues as possible. They will retrofit existing structures throughout the city, including three major venues originally built for the 1964 Summer Games. The Tokyo National Stadium, where the Opening and Closing Ceremonies and the Athletics competitions will be staged, will be completely revamped and replaced by this new Olympic park. By interpreting architecture as natural chaotic systems, the design aims to capture the intuitive, situational, and paradoxical character in Japanese culture, the evanescence and insubstantiality of things, and the transitory nature of the floating world. The atmosphere in the proposed Olympic Park is relaxing with water and vegetation. Venues, tracks, shelters and pedestrian routes are brought together in a continuous, unpredictable and non-linear form, creating the adventure-like visiting experience for both athletes and the public.","The 2020 Tokyo Olympic Park is situated near the Meiji Jingu Gaien, surrounded by national gardens, stadiums and cemetery. In the proximity of Akasaka Imperial Gardens, its post development is subject to many restrictions. With minimum architecture in the future, the park serves as an oasis connecting surrounding outdoor resources. To capture the sensitive characteristics in Japanese culture and make the Olympic Park a dynamic system, vector field and particle movements are chosen to present the correlations within different sports programs as continuously changing swirls.  Variations of orientation charges will result in attractive and repulsive forces. Eighteen eddies were put into the original vector field, where the orientation adjustment is set to be 0.25 * pi. The orientation adjustment caused by eddies damps from the center of effective range to its boundary. Eddies then imparts rejection-attraction forces to the flowing particles nearby, speeding up or down their movements. Venues are mainly designated for indoor sports, as well as the outdoor sports that have strict requirements on tracks. The trajectory of particles is transforming into structure skeletons, with tension membrane being the outer skins.","By viewing architecture as life, it is clear that days are numbered. Decadency comes soon after the day it was built, especially for such sports infrastructure that are built mainly for the two-week games. What we should do is not leaving it isolated, but consider it being a continuously evolving process. 2020: During Tokyo Olympics, temporary stands are merged with the landscape, providing sufficient seats and shelters for the audience. Reusable light steel and removable fabrics are used as the skeleton and skin of the stadiums. 2025: After the Olympics, the stadiums will be transformed into Tokyo Disney Universe, a theme park that aims to help cover expenditures of Tokyo Olympics and attract people to the place after the games. 2035: In the near future, new cultural facilities and trees will gradually replace previous structures as the Olympics’ after effect has gradually faded, while the landscape is maintained in case of future events. The park will then become a forest with bio-diversity and various urban activities. After the Olympics, the park is transformed into an ever-changing, multi-functional urban forest, with thousands of trees grown to provide urban life that embraces nature. Public cultural facilities are built of recyclable materials in a light and fluid manner, making the park a constantly evolving platform for living.",Dynamic Olympic Park design based on time-varying chaotic system.,Decay_Cover.jpg,70.73%,Decay_Short.mp4,"Decay_Still01.jpg,Decay_Still02.jpg,Decay_Still03.jpg,Decay_Still04.jpg,Decay_Still05.jpg,Decay_Still06.jpg,Decay_Still07.jpg,Decay_Still08.jpg",249348231,Vimeo,NA,Dugyu/Chaotic,NA

Modeling provides us accuracy, but the cost is the reduced freedom in conceptual design phase, as it takes a long time to transcript the spacial relations into actual 3d shape. We developed an interactive interface (QT+Python in Rhino) that aids designers in creating non-standard forms. By simply clicking and dragging on our QT interface, designers will set spatial specs through nodes, connections and area ratios, and eventually get 3D editable outputs in Rhino.",Dugyu/CaveArch,NA

Institutions make us feel secure as it is our affiliation, our primary definition and dependence in this society.  Yet we also have the deepest fear that it may trap us, shape us, or assimilate us. Even we are part of an institution, we always have an inherent desire to get rid of it. Meanwhile, the hand going out  of an eye could be a metaphor of our senses toward this world: how we see this world for the first time, how we touch the air, the hard and soft surfaces surround us.

We hide our emotions and feelings behind mobile devices and ubiquitous sapphire screens thereof, let digital technology creates and shapes our social image. By enlarging just one eye through a cell phone, we want to make a metaphor of objectification brought by everyday technology.

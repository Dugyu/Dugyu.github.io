3,Engram,Engram,2018,Fall,"Construct an immersive landscape based on the origin myth that describes how the forest of dreams is formed from interwoven roots of memory traces, curating the experience of flying over an imaginary land to find the dim memories in the deep.",Engram_Cover.jpg,Engram_Short.mp4,"Engram_Cover.jpg,Engram_Draft01.jpg,Engram_Draft02.jpg,Engram_Still001.jpg,Engram_Still004.jpg,Engram_Still005.jpg,Engram_Still006.jpg,Engram_Still007.jpg,Engram_Still008.jpg,Engram_Still009.jpg,Engram_Still010.jpg",391822137,Vimeo,"In the beginning, Consciousness is only complete darkness, with faint sounds at a distance. One day, Consciousness said “ Let my thought be recorded.” Then the first rudimentary memory fragment fell down, as a tiny feather dropped into the deep. The ripples and wakes generated by the first memory formed the basis of the Swamp, where grew the salt crystals, known as the consolidated new memories.  As the memories crystalized more and more, it became hard for Consciousness to find any of the memory he wanted to recall. He decided to categorize them, using the most frequent memory elements to build the major crystal land structures, which lead to other less important ones, and then the most trivial ones. Since then, memories were separated into pieces scattered all over the land,  a retrieval of an original memory fragment would have to rely on a memory trace, called Engram, which points from the initial element to the second, third, … and final ones. This is the Encoding process.<br>A memory is forgotten not because it disappears in this world, though it somehow decays without the nourish of Salt, but that the memory trace is either broken or being intentionally destroyed, which means that there is no way to find it in the memory land. Without being recalled and reinvigorated, it will fall asleep lonely in the deep, glimmer faint. When a new memory is born in the swamp, it will go through the Consolidation process to form connections with existing memories. Insufficient consolidation time leads to weak engrams, which are vulnerable in the wind and rain of emotions. One day in a fierce emotion rain, consciousness found that he had to erase a series of memories to bring peace back, he used Propanonol (lava particles) to cut the Engram deliberately. Thousands of memories lost their traces forever, that being called, the Slaughter. <br>Born from the resentment of the Slaughter there were Malloc and Memset, who are wishes and desires flying over the memory land. They aspire to fool the Consciousness so as to pass important messages to the Intuition. They and the marginalized memories formed a coalition. Malloc collect the gloomy memories in the deep, while Memset edit and initialize them to become the Dreams. Some Dreams escaped from the census of Consciousness, reached the outsider Intuition, and thus were lucky to go into the re-consolidation process. The newly generated Engram grew larger and larger, at last, they together were a forest above the crystal roots.",Engram

In Japanese aesthetics, especially but not only in Noh, beauty contains the idea of decay: beauty must have an air of evanescence, the intimation of its own demise.<br>In Japan, the notion of impermanence is about change and renewal, demolition and rebuilding. In this logic, Tokyo has continued to develop from its parts piecemeal, thus become an endless variety of patchwork. The residents of Tokyo can be compared to urban nomads wandering in artificial forests, for whom, a tent would suffice as shelter.The 2020 Tokyo Olympic Park is situated near the Meiji Jingu Gaien, surrounded by national gardens, stadiums and cemetery. In the proximity of Akasaka Imperial Gardens, it’s post development is subject to many restrictions. With minimum architecture in the future, the park serves as an oasis connecting surrounding outdoor resources.",
5,Sense,Sense,2018,Fall,"Have we changed since we entered this society, started working in some institutions?  Could we maintain our curiosity and sensitivity from the first born? ",Sense_Cover.jpg,Sense_Short.mp4,"Sense_Cover.jpg,Sense_Draft01.jpg,Sense_Draft02.jpg",hHaXASnMgCo,Youtube,"A hand going out of the wall of an institution could be understood as struggling but also sensing.  Institutions make us feel secure as it is our affiliation, our primary definition and dependence in this society.  Yet we also have the deepest fear that it may trap us, shape us, or assimilate us. Even we are part of an institution, we always have an inherent desire to get rid of it. Meanwhile, the hand going out  of an eye could be a metaphor of our senses toward this world: how we see this world for the first time, how we touch the air, the hard and soft surfaces surround us.  Have we changed since we entered this society, started working in these institutions?  Could we maintain our curiosity and sensitivity from the first born?   Are we blind or our body numb?",

When you look at my eye, you are not looking at my physical eye, instead, what you see is actually a virtual eye on a cell phone.  This changes how we look at other people and how we are being looked at. We hide our emotions and feelings behind mobile devices and ubiquitous sapphire screens thereof, let digital technology creates and shapes our social image. By enlarging just one eye through a cell phone, we want to make a metaphor of objectification brought by everyday technology. A delay between two eyes blinking is visible through the delay of the camera signal.  Media Masks is made of cheap cardboard with only cell phones, which is in accordance with the theme of objectification through everyday objects.",
